# Narrate: Pet Text-to-Speech Project

This project utilizes the StyleTTS2 text-to-speech model (available at https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2). The application is designed to process text from PDF files, converting selected text fragments into audio. It is capable of transforming small articles as well as entire books into spoken word.
